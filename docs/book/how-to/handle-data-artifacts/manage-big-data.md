# Scaling Strategies for Big Data in ZenML

As your machine learning projects grow, you'll often encounter datasets that challenge your existing data processing pipelines. This chapter explores strategies for scaling your ZenML pipelines to handle increasingly large datasets. For information on creating custom Dataset classes and managing complex data flows, refer to [custom dataset classes](datasets.md).

## Understanding Dataset Size Thresholds

Before diving into specific strategies, it's important to understand the general thresholds where different approaches become necessary:

1. **Small datasets (up to a few GB)**: These can typically be handled in-memory with standard pandas operations.
2. **Medium datasets (up to tens of GB)**: Require chunking or out-of-core processing techniques.
3. **Large datasets (hundreds of GB or more)**: Necessitate distributed processing frameworks.

## Strategies for Datasets up to a Few Gigabytes

For datasets that can still fit in memory but are becoming unwieldy, consider these optimizations:

1. **Use efficient data formats**: Switch from CSV to more efficient formats like Parquet:

```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

class ParquetDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_path: str):
        self.data_path = data_path

    def read_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        return pq.read_table(self.data_path).to_pandas()

    def write_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame):
        table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)
        pq.write_table(table, self.data_path)
```

2. **Implement basic data sampling**: Add sampling methods to your Dataset classes:

```python
import random

class SampleableDataset(Dataset):
    def sample_data(self, fraction: float = 0.1) -> pd.DataFrame:
        df = self.read_data()
        return df.sample(frac=fraction)

@step
def analyze_sample(dataset: SampleableDataset) -> Dict[str, float]:
    sample = dataset.sample_data(fraction=0.1)
    # Perform analysis on the sample
    return {"mean": sample["value"].mean(), "std": sample["value"].std()}
```

3. **Optimize pandas operations**: Use efficient pandas and numpy operations to minimize memory usage:

```python
@step
def optimize_processing(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Use inplace operations where possible
    df['new_column'] = df['column1'] + df['column2']
    
    # Use numpy operations for speed
    df['mean_normalized'] = df['value'] - np.mean(df['value'])
    
    return df
```

## Handling Datasets up to Tens of Gigabytes

When your data no longer fits comfortably in memory, consider these strategies:

### Chunking for CSV Datasets

Implement chunking in your Dataset classes to process large files in manageable pieces:

```python
class ChunkedCSVDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_path: str, chunk_size: int = 10000):
        self.data_path = data_path
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size

    def read_data(self):
        for chunk in pd.read_csv(self.data_path, chunksize=self.chunk_size):
            yield chunk

@step
def process_chunked_csv(dataset: ChunkedCSVDataset) -> pd.DataFrame:
    processed_chunks = []
    for chunk in dataset.read_data():
        processed_chunks.append(process_chunk(chunk))
    return pd.concat(processed_chunks)

def process_chunk(chunk: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Process each chunk here
    return chunk
```

### Leveraging Data Warehouses for Large Datasets

You can utilize data warehouses like Google BigQuery for its distributed processing capabilities:

```python
@step
def process_big_query_data(dataset: BigQueryDataset) -> BigQueryDataset:
    client = bigquery.Client()
    query = f"""
    SELECT 
        column1, 
        AVG(column2) as avg_column2
    FROM 
        `{dataset.table_id}`
    GROUP BY 
        column1
    """
    result_table_id = f"{dataset.project}.{dataset.dataset}.processed_data"
    job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(destination=result_table_id)
    query_job = client.query(query, job_config=job_config)
    query_job.result()  # Wait for the job to complete
    
    return BigQueryDataset(table_id=result_table_id)
```

## Approaches for Very Large Datasets (Hundreds of Gigabytes or More)

When dealing with extremely large datasets, it's time to leverage distributed processing frameworks. ZenML allows you to integrate these frameworks directly into your pipeline steps.

### Using Apache Spark

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

@step
def process_with_spark(dataset: BigQueryDataset) -> None:
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("BigDataProcessing").getOrCreate()
    
    # Read data from BigQuery
    df = spark.read.format("bigquery").option("table", dataset.table_id).load()
    
    # Process data using Spark
    result = df.groupBy("column1").agg({"column2": "mean"})
    
    # Write results back to BigQuery
    result.write.format("bigquery").option("table", "project.dataset.result_table").mode("overwrite").save()
```

### Using Ray

```python
import ray

@ray.remote
def process_partition(partition):
    # Process a partition of the data
    return processed_partition

@step
def process_with_ray(dataset: BigQueryDataset) -> None:
    ray.init()
    
    # Read data from BigQuery (you might need to implement this part)
    data = read_from_bigquery(dataset.table_id)
    
    # Distribute processing across Ray cluster
    partitions = split_data(data)
    results = ray.get([process_partition.remote(part) for part in partitions])
    
    # Combine results and write back to BigQuery
    combined_results = combine_results(results)
    write_to_bigquery(combined_results, "project.dataset.result_table")
```

## Choosing the Right Scaling Strategy

When selecting a scaling strategy, consider:

1. **Dataset size**: Start with simpler strategies for smaller datasets and move to more complex solutions as your data grows.
2. **Processing complexity**: Simple aggregations might be handled by BigQuery, while complex ML preprocessing might require Spark or Ray.
3. **Infrastructure and resources**: Ensure you have the necessary compute resources for distributed processing.
4. **Update frequency**: Consider how often your data changes and how frequently you need to reprocess it.
5. **Team expertise**: Choose technologies that your team is comfortable with or can quickly learn.

Remember, it's often best to start simple and scale up as needed. ZenML's flexible architecture allows you to evolve your data processing strategies as your project grows.

By implementing these scaling strategies, you can extend your ZenML pipelines to handle datasets of any size, ensuring that your machine learning workflows remain efficient and manageable as your projects scale.
