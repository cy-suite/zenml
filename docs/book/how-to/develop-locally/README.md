# Develop locally

This section contains information around best practices for developing your
pipelines locally. It's common to do at least some work locally where you can
iterate faster, and where it doesn't take much time or money to run your
pipeline. People often do this with a smaller subset of their data, or with
synthetic data.

ZenML supports this pattern and the sections that follow guide you through this
pattern of working locally and then (at certain moments) pushing and running
your pipelines on more powerful remote hardware.
