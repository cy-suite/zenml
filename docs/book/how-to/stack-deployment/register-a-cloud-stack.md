# Register a cloud stack with existing infrastructure

In ZenML, the [stack]() is a fundamental concept that represents the 
configuration of your infrastructure. In a normal workflow, creating a stack
requires you to first deploy the necessary pieces of infrastructure and then 
define them as stack components in ZenML with proper authentication.

Especially in a remote setting, this process can sometimes be challenging and 
time-consuming, and it may create a multi-faceted problem. This is why we 
implemented a feature called the stack wizard, that allows you to **browse 
through your existing infrastructure and use it to register a ZenML cloud 
stack**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have the required infrastructure pieces already deployed
on your cloud, you can also use the 1-click deployment tool to build your 
cloud stack.
{% endhint %}

# How to use the Stack Wizard

The stack wizard can only be accessed through the CLI:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}

In order to create a remote stack over the CLI you can use the following 
command:

```shell
zenml stack register <STACK_NAME> -p aws
```

### AWS

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, the stack wizard only works on AWS. We are working on bringing 
support to GCP and Azure as well. Stay in touch for further updates.

We are working hard to bring this feature to our dashboard as well. Stay in 
touch for further updates.
