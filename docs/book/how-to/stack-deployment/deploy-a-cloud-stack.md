# Deploy a cloud stack with a single click

In ZenML, the [stack]() is a fundamental concept that represents the 
configuration of your infrastructure. In a normal workflow, creating a stack
requires you to first deploy the necessary pieces of infrastructure and then 
define them as stack components in ZenML with proper authentication.

Especially in a remote setting, this process can sometimes be challenging and 
time-consuming, and it may create a multi-faceted problem. This is why we 
implemented a feature, that allows you to **deploy the necessary pieces of 
infrastructure on your selected cloud provider and get you started on remote 
stack with a single click**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have the required infrastructure pieces already deployed on your cloud, 
you can also use the stack wizard to seamlessly register your stack.
{% endhint %}

## How to use 1-click deployment tool?

To use the 1-click deployment tool, you can either use the dashboard or 
the CLI:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Dashboard" %}

In order to create a remote stack over the dashboard go to the stacks page 
on the dashboard and click "Create New Stack".

Since we will be deploying it from scratch, select "New Infrastructure" on the
next page:

![Options for registering a stack](../../.gitbook/assets/register_stack_page.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, the 1-click deployment only works on AWS. We are working on 
supporting GCP and Azure as well. Stay in touch for further updates.

{% endhint %}

### AWS

If you choose `aws` as your provider, you will see a page where you will have 
the select an authentication method and a name for your new stack:

![Configuring the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws.png)

Once the configuration is finished, you will see a deployment page:

![Deploying the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws_2.png)

During this process, you  will be redirected you to a Cloud Formation page 
on AWS. You will have to log in to your AWS account, review and confirm the 
pre-filled configuration and create the stack.

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}

In order to create a remote stack over the CLI you can use the following 
command:

```shell
zenml stack deploy -p aws
```

### AWS 

If you choose `aws` as your provider, this command will redirect you to 
a Cloud Formation page on AWS. You will have to log in to your AWS 
account, review and confirm the pre-filled configuration and create the stack.

{% endtabs %}

## What will be deployed?

Here is an overview of the infrastructure that the 1-click deployment will
prepare for you:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="AWS" %}
- A ZenML AWS Service Connector based on your selected authentication method.
- A ZenML Sagemaker Orchestrator which is preconfigured.
- An S3 bucket that will be used as a ZenML Artifact Store.
- An ECR container registry that will be used as a ZenML Container Registry.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="GCP" %}
We are working on bringing the 1-click deployment to GCP! Stay in
touch for further updates.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Azure" %}
We are working on bringing the 1-click deployment to Azure! Stay in
touch for further updates.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

And, there you have it! With a single click, you just deployed a cloud stack 
and, you can start running your pipelines on a remote setting.
