# Deploy a cloud stack with a single click

In ZenML, the [stack](../../user-guide/production-guide/understand-stacks.md) 
is a fundamental concept that represents the configuration of your 
infrastructure. In a normal workflow, creating a stack
requires you to first deploy the necessary pieces of infrastructure and then 
define them as stack components in ZenML with proper authentication.

Especially in a remote setting, this process can be challenging and 
time-consuming, and it may create multi-faceted problems. This is why we 
implemented a feature, that allows you to **deploy the necessary pieces of 
infrastructure on your selected cloud provider and get you started on remote 
stack with a single click**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have the required infrastructure pieces already deployed on your cloud, 
you can also use [the stack wizard to seamlessly register your stack](register-a-cloud-stack.md).
{% endhint %}

## How to use the 1-click deployment tool?

The first thing that you need in order to use this feature is a
deployed instance of ZenML (not a local server via `zenml up`). If you do 
not already have it set up for you, feel free to learn how to do so
[here](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/README.md).

Once you are connected to your deployed ZenML instance, you can use the 
1-click deployment tool either through the dashboard or the CLI:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Dashboard" %}

In order to create a remote stack over the dashboard go to the stacks page 
on the dashboard and click "+ New Stack".

Since we will be deploying it from scratch, select "New Infrastructure" on the
next page:

![Options for registering a stack](../../.gitbook/assets/register_stack_page.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, the 1-click deployment only works on AWS and GCP. We are working on 
bringing support to Azure as well. Stay in touch for further updates.
{% endhint %}

![Choosing a cloud provider](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_selection.png)

### AWS

If you choose `aws` as your provider, you will see a page where you will have 
to select a region and a name for your new stack:

![Configuring the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws.png)

Once the configuration is finished, you will see a deployment page:

![Deploying the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws_2.png)

During this process, you will be redirected to a Cloud Formation page on AWS Console. 

![Cloudformation page](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws_cloudformation_intro.png)

You will have to log in to your AWS account, review and confirm the 
pre-filled configuration and create the stack.

![Finalizing the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws_cloudformation.png)

### GCP

If you choose `gcp` as your provider, you will see a page where you will have 
to select a region and a name for your new stack:

![Configuring the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp.png)

Once the configuration is finished, you will see a deployment page:

![Deploying the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_2.png)

During this process, you will be redirected to a Cloud Shell session on GCP.

![GCP Cloud Shell start page](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_cloudshell_start.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Cloud Shell session will warn you that the ZenML GitHub repository is
untrusted. We recommend that you review
[the contents of the repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/infra/gcp)
and then check the `Trust repo` checkbox to proceed with the deployment,
otherwise the Cloud Shell session will not be authenticated to access your
GCP projects. You will also get a chance to review the scripts that will be
executed in the Cloud Shell session before proceeding.
{% endhint %}

After the Cloud Shell session starts, you will be guided through the process of
authenticating with GCP, configuring your deployment, and finally provisioning
the resources for your new GCP stack using Deployment Manager.

First, you will be asked to create or choose an existing GCP project with billing
enabled and to configure your terminal with the selected project:

![GCP Cloud Shell tutorial step 1](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_cloudshell_step_1.png)

Next, you will be asked to configure your deployment by pasting the configuration
values that were provided to you in the ZenML dashboard:

![GCP Cloud Shell tutorial step 2](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_cloudshell_step_2.png)

You can take this opportunity to review the script that will be executed at the
next step. You will notice that this script starts by enabling some necessary
GCP service APIs and configuring some basic permissions for the service accounts
involved in the stack deployment, and then deploys the stack using a GCP
Deployment Manager template. You can proceed with the deployment by running the
script in your terminal:

![GCP Cloud Shell tutorial step 3](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_cloudshell_step_3.png)

The script will deploy a GCP Deployment Manager template that provisions the
necessary resources for your new GCP stack and automatically registers the stack
with your ZenML server. You can monitor the progress of the deployment in your
GCP console:

![GCP Deployment Manager progress](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_dm_progress.png)

Once the deployment is complete, you may close the Cloud Shell session and return
to the ZenML dashboard to view the newly created stack:

![GCP Stack dashboard output](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_dashboard_output.png)

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}

In order to create a remote stack over the CLI, you can use the following 
command:

```shell
zenml stack deploy -p {aws|gcp}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, the 1-click deployment only works on AWS and GCP. We are working on 
bringing support to Azure as well. 

In the meanwhile, you can still deploy an Azure stack manually, meaning
you can deploy the infrastructure yourself and create the necessary ZenML 
components yourself using the corresponding integrations. Check [our component 
guide](../../component-guide/component-guide.md) for further details.
{% endhint %}

### AWS

If you choose `aws` as your provider, this command will redirect you to a 
Cloud Formation page on AWS: 

![Cloudformation page](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws_cloudformation_intro.png)

You will have to log in to your AWS account, have permission to deploy an AWS 
CloudFormation script, review and confirm the pre-filled configuration and 
create the stack.

![Finalizing the new stack](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_aws_cloudformation.png)

### GCP

If you choose `gcp` as your provider, this command will redirect you to a Cloud Shell session on GCP.

![GCP Cloud Shell start page](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy_stack_gcp_cloudshell_start.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
