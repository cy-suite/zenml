Are you tired of constantly tweaking code to adjust your pipeline 
configurations? Meet **Run Templates**, a powerful ZenML Pro feature designed 
to simplify and accelerate your workflow!

## What are Run Templates?

**Run Templates** are pre-defined, parameterized configurations for your ZenML 
pipelines that can be easily executed from the ZenML dashboard or via our 
Client/REST API. Think of them as blueprints for your pipeline runs, ready 
to be customized on the fly.

## Why Use Run Templates?

- **Efficient Iteration**: Test different configurations rapidly without 
modifying your codebase.
- **Accessibility**: Empower non-technical team members to run pipelines with 
custom parameters.
- **API-Friendly**: Perfect for integration with other tools and 
automation workflows.
