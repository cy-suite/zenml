# Trigger a pipeline from the REST API

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a [ZenML Pro](https://zenml.io/pro) only feature. Please [sign up here](https://cloud.zenml.io) get access.
OSS users can only trigger a pipeline by calling the pipeline function inside their runner script.
{% endhint %}

Triggering a pipeline from the REST API **only** works with pipelines that are already built with a remote stack
(i.e. at least a remote orchestrator, artifact store, and container registry). Most of the times, this means
you can only *re-run* a pipeline with a remote stack using a different configuration.

As a pre-requisite, you need a pipeline name and version. After you have it, there are three calls that need to be made in order to trigger a pipeline from the REST API:

1. `GET /pipelines?name=<PIPELINE_NAME>&version=<PIPELINE_VERSION>` -> This returns a response, where a <PIPELINE_ID> can be copied
2. `GET /pipeline_builds?pipeline_id=<PIPELINE_ID>` -> This returns a list of responses where a <BUILD_ID> can be chosen
3. `POST /pipeline_builds/<BUILD_ID>/runs` -> This runs the pipeline. You can pass the [PipelineRunConfiguration](https://sdkdocs.zenml.io/latest/core_code_docs/core-config/#zenml.config.pipeline_run_configuration.PipelineRunConfiguration) in the body

The above set of REST calls means that you can only trigger a pipeline that has been [built before](../customize-docker-builds/reuse-docker-builds.md) on a remote stack.

## A worked example

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn how to get a bearer token for the curl commands [here](../../reference/api-reference.md#using-a-bearer-token-to-access-the-api-programmatically).
{% endhint %}

Here is an example. Let's say would we like to re-run a pipeline called `training`. We first query the `/pipelines` endpoint:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_URL>/api/v1/pipelines?hydrate=false&name=training&version=45' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>'
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/rest_api_step_1.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Identifying the pipeline ID</p></figcaption></figure>

We can take the ID from any object in the list of responses. In this case, the <PIPELINE_ID> is `c953985e-650a-4cbf-a03a-e49463f58473` in the response.

After this, we take the pipeline ID and call the `/pipeline_builds?pipeline_id=<PIPELINE_ID>` API:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
  '<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_URL>/api/v1/pipeline_builds?hydrate=false&logical_operator=and&page=1&size=20&pipeline_id=b826b714-a9b3-461c-9a6e-1bde3df3241d' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>'
```

We can now take the <BUILD_ID> from this response. Here it is `b826b714-a9b3-461c-9a6e-1bde3df3241d`.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/rest_api_step_2.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Identifying the build ID</p></figcaption></figure>

Finally, we can use the build ID to trigger the pipeline with a different configuration:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  '<YOUR_ZENML_SERVER_URL>/api/v1/pipeline_builds/b826b714-a9b3-461c-9a6e-1bde3df3241d/runs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>' \
  -d '{
  "steps": {"model_trainer": {"parameters": {"model_type": "rf"}}}
}'
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The pipeline that you're triggering has to have been run previously on a remote stack. In other words, the functionality to trigger a pipeline from another only works when a Docker image has previously been built for that pipeline. In most cases this will be because you ran the pipeline already, but in some cases you might have built the image separately.
{% endhint %}

A positive response means your pipeline has been re-triggered with a different config!
