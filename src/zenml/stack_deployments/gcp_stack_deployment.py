You will be redirected to a GCP Cloud Shell console in your browser where you'll
be asked to log into your GCP project and then create a Deployment Manager
deployment to provision the necessary cloud resources for ZenML.

The deployment parameters will be pre-filled with the necessary information to
connect ZenML to your GCP project, so you should only need to review and confirm
the stack.

After the Deployment Manager deployment is complete, you can return to the CLI
to view details about the associated ZenML stack automatically registered with
ZenML.

**NOTE**: The Deployment Manager deployment will create the following new
resources in your GCP project. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions
and are aware of any potential costs:

- A GCS bucket registered as a [ZenML artifact store](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/artifact-stores/gcp).
- A Google Artifact Registry registered as a [ZenML container registry](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/container-registries/gcp).
- Vertex AI registered as a [ZenML orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/vertex).
- A GCP Service Account with the minimum necessary permissions to access the
above resources.
- An GCP Service Account access key used to give access to ZenML to connect to
the above resources through a [ZenML service connector](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/auth-management/gcp-service-connector).

The Deployment Manager deployment will automatically create a GCP Service
Account secret key and will share it with ZenML to give it permission to access
the resources created by the stack. You can revoke these permissions at any time
by deleting the Deployment Manager deployment in the GCP Cloud Console.
