    """Great Expectation expectation configuration.

    This class defines the configuration parameters that can be used to
    customize the behavior of a Great Expectation Expectation. This includes
    the expectation name (in snake case), and any input options that the
    expectation expects. This could be the column name, the value to 
    compare against, etc.

    You can also choose to pass in parameters as the value to an input option. 
    You can then supply the parameters as a dictionary to the expectation_parameters 
    field. But this is not particularly useful when you are defining the expectations 
    directly with ZenML. The value of defining parameters in expectations and 
    passing the values at runtime is more pronounced when you already have a suite 
    of expectations defined and you use this suite with ZenML, with different 
    parameters.

    Attributes:
        expectation_name: The name of the Great Expectation expectation to apply in snake case.
        expectation_args: Input arguments to pass to the expectation. These can be 
            used to pass the column name, the value to compare against, etc.
