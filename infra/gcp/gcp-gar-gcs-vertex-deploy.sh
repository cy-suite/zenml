# Configure your deployment
#
# The following variables must be configured before running the deployment
# script:
#
# * ZENML_STACK_NAME - The name of the ZenML stack to deploy. This name will be
# used to identify the stack in the ZenML server and the GCP Deployment Manager.
# * ZENML_STACK_REGION - The GCP region to deploy the resources to. Pick one
# from the list of available regions documented at: https://cloud.google.com/about/locations
# * ZENML_SERVER_URL: The URL where your ZenML server is running
# * ZENML_SERVER_API_TOKEN: The API token used to authenticate with your ZenML
# server. This would have been provided to you in the ZenML CLI or the ZenML
# dashboard when you triggered this tutorial.

# Enable the necessary services
#
# The following services must be enabled in your GCP project:
#
# * Deployment Manager - used to provision infrastructure resources.
# * IAM API - used to manage permissions.
# * Artifact Registry API - ZenML uses the Artifact Registry GCP service to store and manage Docker images.
# * Cloud Storage API - ZenML uses the Cloud Storage GCP service to store and manage data.
# * Vertex AI API - ZenML uses the Vertex AI GCP service to manage machine learning resources.
# * Cloud Functions API - used to automatically register the ZenML stack in the ZenML server.
# * Cloud Build and Compute Engine API - required for the Cloud Functions to run.
