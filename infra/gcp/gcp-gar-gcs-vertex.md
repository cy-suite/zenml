# Welcome to the ZenML GCP Stack Deployment Tutorial

This tutorial will assist you in deploying a full ZenML GCP stack in your
GCP project using Deployment Manager. After the Deployment Manager deployment is
complete, you can return to the CLI or dashboard to view details about the
associated ZenML stack that is automatically registered with ZenML.

## Let's get started!

**Estimated time to complete**: <walkthrough-tutorial-duration duration=5></walkthrough-tutorial-duration>

**Prerequisites**:

* A GCP Cloud Billing account
* ZenML Server URL and API token

Click **Start** to begin.

## Make sure you are authenticated with GCP

<walkthrough-project-setup billing=true>Select the GCP Project in which to deploy the stack.</walkthrough-project-setup>

`Note:` In order to be able to install the ZenML stack successfully, you need to have billing enabled for your project.

Then run the following command to authorize and configure the selected project in your Cloud Shell terminal:

```sh
gcloud config set project <walkthrough-project-name/>
```

üí° Click the 'Copy to Cloud Shell' button to copy and run the command to your
terminal

If your Cloud Shell is running in untrusted mode, you may also need to run the
following command to authenticate with GCP:

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

## Configure your deployment

Now, let's configure the ZenML stack deployment.

You were provided with a set of configuration values when you triggered this
flow through the ZenML dashboard or CLI that looks like the following:

```
### BEGIN CONFIGURATION ###
...
...
### END CONFIGURATION ###
```

To configure your deployment, you need to simply copy these values and paste
them <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="gcp-gar-gcs-vertex-deploy.sh" regex="### BEGIN CONFIGURATION(\n|.)*?END CONFIGURATION ###">into the stack deployment script</walkthrough-editor-select-regex>.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure the `ZENML_SERVER_API_TOKEN` value is not broken into multiple lines as this will lead to errors !

## Deploy the ZenML stack

Run the deployment script to deploy the stack with Deployment Manager:

```sh
./gcp-gar-gcs-vertex-deploy.sh
```

üí° Click the 'Copy to Cloud Shell' button to copy and run the command in your
terminal

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

If the previous command completed successfully, then you're all set!

The ZenML stack resources have been provisioned in your GCP project. You can
view and manage the resources created in the GCP Deployment Manager Console by
following the URL provided in the output.

The ZenML stack has also been automatically registered with your ZenML server
and you may now close the Cloud Shell session and switch back to the ZenML
dashboard or the ZenML CLI to continue your workflow.

**Don't forget to clean up**: When you're done using the ZenML GCP stack, be
sure to delete the GCP Deployment Manager deployment to avoid unnecessary
charges. You will need to delete the data in your GCS bucket manually before
the deployment can be deleted.
